Journal to document 100 doc journey 
 Day 1: 1/09/2025 
 - Setup Github and Dev Accounts and learn about ssh and refresh memory on git intitialisation commands
 - I also researched into SSL certificates. Figuring out a way to add a free ssl certificate for a website in hosted with LDN
 - Discovered that they may be a way using cloudflare but in the lcn host they need to disable DNSSEC
 - DNSSEC is a cryptographic signature that allows the signatures to be registered with the DNS registered on the host
 - Cloudflare needs the dns domain to disable it so that when the namespace is changes to its own there are no clashes
 - LCN doesn't provide a self-service for the user to directly update this so i created a support ticket and hopefully this can be disabled to continue with the progress of that work
 - Also started AI & Machine learning course - learnt what machine learning is 

Day 2: 2/09/2025 
- Gone through web development training course
- Continued to work on Praying Promises website

Day 3: 3/09/2025
- Continued on web development courses
