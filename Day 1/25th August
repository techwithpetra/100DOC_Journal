### DAY 1: Monday 25th August 2025 
Discovered that they may be a way using cloudflare but in the lcn host they need to disable DNSSEC
DNSSEC is a cryptographic signature that allows the signatures to be registered with the DNS registered on the host
Cloudflare needs the dns domain to disable it so that when the namespace is changes to its own there are no clashes
LCN doesn't provide a self-service for the user to directly update this so i created a support ticket and hopefully this can be disabled to continue with the progress of that work
Also started AI & Machine learning course - learnt what machine learning is
